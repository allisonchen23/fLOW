# fLOW
Code for fLOW, a personal water usage tracker. fLOW is a project through Creative Labs at UCLA led by Allison Chen and Carla Cornillon.

### Motivation
We would like to work with the intersection between technology and engineering and sustainability. Each and every one of us wastes water while we're washing our hands, brushing our teeth, etc. The goal of this project is to develop a device to measure water usage and display a user's trends over time. By bringing attention and awareness to the problem, individuals can actively make lifestyle changes to play their part in conserving water.
